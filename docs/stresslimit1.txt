Hey Charles,

How bout we try a little excercise right away? Want to make this into html/css? We had said $30/hr how many hours do you think this would take you? Can you be super-meticulous with front-end stuff like this [meaning is this / can this be your fort√©]? Very minimal splash page.

Requirements:
* cleanliness/slickness is the most important. This is our [only] client-facing contact point, needs to be slick right away visually and if people view source
* transparent boxes with text on top should come from semi-transparent background pngs
* containers cannot be fixed-height
* all text must be webtext except stresslimit logo, which must be h1 with text-indent
* main content to be centred on the beige background
* links are:

Hi Colin,

I'll work up a time estimate.
This is a perfect exercise to get familiar with your other work.

Couple questions:
1. Webtext? Does that mean the same as plain-text, as compared to image embedded text?
2. Could you send me a png screenshot to verify that the pdf file is as you see it in photoshop?


Cheers
-Charles
